# Scientific Data Analysis  

This repository tracks my scientific data analyses conducted during my research as a condensed matter physicist. It covers a wide range of topics related to analyzing data from materials in polycrystalline and single-crystalline forms, including:  

- **Physical property measurements** (susceptibility, magnetization, specific heat)  
- **Crystal structure analysis** (neutron and X-ray diffraction)  
- **Neutron scattering** (diffuse scattering for short-range correlations, inelastic scattering for excitations)  

I am highly enthusiastic about **programming and data analysis**, utilizing different programming languages (**Python, MATLAB, Mathematica, Julia, C**) and software tools, selecting the best approach for each problem.  

I am sharing these works to encourage discussion and feedback. I hope they are useful to others. Below are some highlights‚Äîthere's much more to explore in this repository!

## üîç Machine Learning for Short-Range Spin Correlations in Gd‚ÇÇHf‚ÇÇO‚Çá  

A conventional approach to identifying spin correlations in a magnetic system involves defining multiple order parameters based on prior knowledge‚Äîan experience-dependent process.  

In this project, I applied **unsupervised machine learning** to automatically identify dominant correlation patterns in the data.

- **Code:** [Machine Learning Analysis](./Reverse_Monte_Carlo_analysis/Gd2Hf2O7/Machine_learning.ipynb)  

I also attempted a **statistical analysis** by measuring angles between vectors. While it produced similar results, it was less efficient and less coder-friendly.

## üìä Mean-Field Analysis of Neutron Diffuse Scattering of Classical Spin Liquids  

**Mean field theory (MFT)** was originally developed over a century ago to study high-dimensional stochastic models. It has since been applied across various fields.  

In this project, I used **MFT to analyze neutron diffuse scattering data**, a computationally demanding task requiring extensive spherical averaging. To optimize performance, I implemented the calculations using the [Numba Python compiler](https://numba.pydata.org/) on a **high-performance computing (HPC) cluster**.

## üåÄ Exploring Large 4D Neutron Spectroscopy Datasets (~100GB)  

Modern **time-of-flight neutron spectrometers** generate massive four-dimensional datasets (momentum & energy). Manually slicing and cutting through such data is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and requires significant expertise.  

To streamline this process, I developed an **automated Python pipeline** that:  

‚úÖ Loads and processes data  
‚úÖ Performs peak detection and fitting  
‚úÖ Exports results for further analysis

## üî¨ Automating Crystal Field Analysis  

[SPECTRA](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/boothroyd/software) is a widely used tool for analyzing **crystal electric field interactions**. However, its outdated **command-line interface** requires manual input of dozens of parameters‚Äîone by one‚Äîmaking it tedious and error-prone.  

To improve efficiency, I automated the interaction process using **Python + Pexpect + Re**, allowing for batch processing and systematic exploration of parameter space.

## ‚öôÔ∏è X-ray/Neutron Diffraction Analysis  

X-ray and neutron diffraction are standard techniques for determining and refining crystal structures. To automate the visualization of diffraction fits, I developed a Python script to **load and plot [FullProf](https://www.ill.eu/sites/fullprof/) fit results in one step**, significantly improving workflow efficiency.
